We present explicit height bounds for integral points on coarse Hilbert moduli schemes. To illustrate the main result, we discuss various explicit examples. We also explain the strategy of proof which combines the method of Faltings (Arakelov, Parsin, Szpiro) with modularity. This is joint work with Arno Kret.
