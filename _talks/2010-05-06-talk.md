**Abstract:** Let K be a number field and let S be a finite set of places of K. A classical theorem of Shafarevich says that there are only finitely many K-isomorphism classes of elliptic curves over K with good reduction outside S. An effective version of this statement for K=Q was already proved by Coates. In the talk we discuss an extension to arbitrary number fields. We give explicit bounds and compare them with the one obtained by Coates. This is joint work with Clemens Fuchs and Gisbert WÃ¼stholz.
