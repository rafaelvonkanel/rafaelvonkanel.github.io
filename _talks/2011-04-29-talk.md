**Abstract:** In 1982 Szpiro conjectured that there is a constant c such that if E is an elliptic curve over Q of minimal discriminant D and conductor N, then \\(|∆|\leq N^c\\). This conjecture is equivalent to the abc-conjecture. In the talk we give the unconditional result log \\(|∆|\leq N^c\\). The proof is based on the theory of logarithmic forms. We bound the relative Faltings height of E polynomially in terms of N which leads to the desired estimate.
