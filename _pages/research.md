#### Diophantine equations and moduli schemes  
<div style="text-align: justify !important; text-justify: inter-word;" markdown="1"><small>Since 2011, my research focuses on the development of an effective strategy (surveyed in [2]) for Diophantine equations related to moduli schemes. To get an idea, see the IAS [talk](www.ias.edu/video/short/vonkenel) (2011) on a first application to the classical Mordell equations \\(x^3-y^2=a\\).</small>
