#### Diophantine equations and moduli schemes

<small>Since 2011, my research focuses on the development of an effective strategy (surveyed in [2]) for Diophantine equations related to moduli schemes. To get an idea see for example the [talk](www.ias.edu/video/short/vonkenel) at IAS (2011) which gives a first application of the strategy to the classical Mordell equations \\(x^3-y^2=a\\).</small>
