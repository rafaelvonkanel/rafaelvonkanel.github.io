#### Diophantine equations and moduli schemes  
<div style="text-align: justify !important; text-justify: inter-word;" markdown="1"><small>Since 2011, my research focuses on the development of an effective strategy (surveyed in [2]) for Diophantine equations related to moduli schemes. To get an idea see the IAS [talk](www.ias.edu/video/short/vonkenel) (2011) on a first application to the classical Mordell equations \\(x^3-y^2=a\\).</small>

[4] *Solving classical Diophantine equations*: This joint project with B. Matschke consists of three parts.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) *Solving \\(S\\)-unit, Mordell, Thue, Thue–Mahler and generalized Ramanujan–Nagell equations via Shimura–Taniyama conjecture* (2016, [abstract](../_research/proj2.md), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06079), [journal](https://bookstore.ams.org/view?ProductCode=MEMO/286/1419)): With B. Matschke.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) Construction of rigorous algorithms ([source code](https://github.com/bmatschke/solving-classical-diophantine-equations) in SageMath) which allow to efficiently solve various classical Diophantine problems.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) Application of the algorithms in (ii) to obtain unconditionally complete [databases](https://bmatschke.github.io/solving-classical-diophantine-equations/) containing all solutions of large classes of classical Diophantine problems: The data allows to motivate/test classical conjectures and it led to the discovery of [new conjectures](https://bmatschke.github.io/solving-classical-diophantine-equations/) in (i).  
[5] *Modularity and integral points on moduli schemes* (2013, [abstract](../_research/proj2.md), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.7263)). This project consists of two parts: Sections 1-7 are published in (i), and the remaining part is published in (ii) except Section 9.4 which was included in [3].
