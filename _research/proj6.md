**Abstract:** The purpose of this paper is to give some new Diophantine applications of modularity results. We use the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture to prove effective finiteness results for integral points on moduli schemes of elliptic curves. For several fundamental Diophantine problems (e.g. \\(S-\\)unit and Mordell equations), this gives an effective method which does not rely on Diophantine approximation or transcendence techniques. We also combine Faltings’ method with Serre’s modularity conjecture, isogeny estimates and results from Arakelov theory, to establish the effective Shafarevich conjecture for abelian varieties of (product) \\(\text{GL}_2-\\)type. In particular, we open the way for the effective study of integral points on certain higher dimensional moduli schemes.
