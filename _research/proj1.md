Let \\(X\\) be a variety over \\(\mathbb{Q}\\). We introduce a geometric non-degenerate criterion for \\(X\\) using moduli spaces \\(M\\) over \\(\mathbb{Q}\\) of abelian varieties. If \\(X\\) is non-degenerate, then we construct via \\(M\\) an open dense moduli space \\(U\subseteq X\\) whose forgetful map defines a ParÅ¡in construction for \\(U(\mathbb{Q})\\). For example if \\(M\\) is a Hilbert modular variety then \\(U\\) is a coarse Hilbert moduli scheme and \\(X\\) is non-degenerate iff a projective model \\(Y\subset \bar{M}\\) of \\(X\\) over \\(\mathbb{Q}\\) contains no singular points of the minimal compactification \\(\bar{M}\\). We motivate our constructions when \\(M\\) is a rational variety over \\(\mathbb{Q}\\) with \\(\dim(M)>\dim(X)\\).

We study various geometric aspects of the non-degenerate criterion and we deduce arithmetic applications: If \\(X\\) is non-degenerate, then \\(\mathbb{Q}\\) is finite by Faltings. Moreover, our constructions are made for the effective strategy which combines the method of Faltings (Arakelov, Par&scaron;in, Szpiro) with modularity and Masser-W&uuml;stholz isogeny estimates. When \\(M\\) is a coarse Hilbert moduli scheme, we use this strategy to explicitly bound the height and the number of \\(x\in U(\mathbb{QQ})\\) if \\(X\\)is non-degenerate. 


We illustrate our approach in the case when $M$ is the Hilbert modular surface given by the classical icosahedron surface studied by Clebsch, Klein and Hirzebruch. For any curve $X$ over \\(\mathbb{QQ}\\), we construct and study explicit projective models $Y\subset\bar{M}$ called ico models. If \\(X\\) is non-degenerate, then we give via $Y$ an effective Par&scaron;in construction and an explicit Weil height bound for \\(x\in U(\mathbb{QQ})\\). As most ico models are non-degenerate and \\(X\setminus U\\) is controlled,  this establishes the effective Mordell conjecture for large classes of (explicit) curves over \\(\mathbb{QQ}\\). We also solve the ico analogue of the generalized Fermat problem by combining our height bounds with Diophantine approximations.
