**Abstract:** We combine the method of Faltings (Arakelov, Par&scaron;in, Szpiro) with the Shimura–Taniyama conjecture to prove eﬀective ﬁniteness results for integral points on moduli schemes of elliptic curves. For several fundamental Diophantine problems, such as for example \\(S-\\)unit and Mordell equations, this gives an eﬀective method which does not rely on Diophantine approximation or transcendence techniques.
